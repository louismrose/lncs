In this paper, we have presented {\em Umbra Designer}, a tool for the graphical development of ``server-side'' telephony services.
The tool facilitates the construction of services by non-experts. It includes a code generator that relies on the
{\em Umbra framework}, a Java API that is used to build services based on the JAIN SLEE standard.
Some initial experiments show promising results regarding efficiency gain for the
construction of services, with respect to a direct use of the API. We believe this will be especially interesting for 
customer companies and users with no deep knowledge of JAIN SLEE or telecommunication applications.

In the future, we plan to improve the tool with further functionality to consider more advanced services. In some
cases, we think it is possible to generate automatically a graphical user interface for a mobile app (iOS, Android)
starting from the state machine description of the voice dialogue. We also plan to investigate exhaustive testing
of service models against user actions and to make the tool publicly available in the immediate future.
