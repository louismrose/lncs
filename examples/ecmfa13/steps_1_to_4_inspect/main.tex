% In order to generate an Author Index do the following:
% After TeXing this document start the program MakeIndex by typing
% MAKEINDX -S SPRMINDX.STY <filename>
% (generates an IND file for the Author Index)
% into the DOS command line.
% (At other systems you may have to use the command MAKEINDEX.)
% Now TeX this file once again, then you will get an Author Index.
% TeX this file once more, then the TOC will be complete.
